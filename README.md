We have completed the second generation of Nepali Input Tools. We will be able to release this on first week of June after full check of texts. After this release, we are going to start text to speech system (Nepali text reader).

We are looking for mostly financial and work related support. Currently this is a single man task. Your support will be helpful to develop Nepali text reader.
